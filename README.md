My Project Report: Building the Team India Cricket Hub Fanpage üèè
Honestly, the biggest challenge wasn't just building the pages‚Äîit was making them look genuinely professional and branded, not just copied from a template. The entire project took me about 10 hours in total.

The Process: Getting to the Finish Line
I started by tackling the theme. I knew the default blue had to go, so I created custom CSS overrides for the Indian team's Navy Blue and Saffron colors (.bg-primary-custom and .btn-accent). Once I had those colors locked in, the whole site instantly felt real.

From there, it was all about Bootstrap remixing:

The Look of Realism: My main goal was a modern feel. I achieved this by constantly using Bootstrap utilities like shadow-lg on all the cards and adding a custom .card-hover effect. This gave every element a subtle lift, instantly making the UI feel polished and expensive.

The teams.html Breakthrough: This page became my favorite. Instead of boring vertical player cards, I used a nested grid inside each card component to split the profile: Virat Kohli's photo on the left, stats on the right (col-md-5 and col-md-7). This is a classic sports website look, and I was proud I could build it purely by remixing Bootstrap components.

The Contact Page: I kept the contact page super clean, splitting the screen perfectly using the Bootstrap grid (col-lg-7 and col-lg-5) for the form and the info block.

My Transparency Check
Yes, I used AI (Gemini) quite a bit, primarily for rapid prototyping and checking small syntax details in the massive framework. For example, if I needed a specific padding utility, I'd confirm the correct p-* class quickly. But the creative decisions‚Äîlike choosing the Navy/Saffron colors, deciding on the split card layout for the player profiles, and making sure the overall composition was clean‚Äîwere all mine, driven by the project's brief. I never copy-pasted full example pages; I only extracted concepts and rebuilt them.

What I Learned
The biggest takeaway was learning to stop fighting the framework and start using the utilities to their full potential. I realized that the secret to great Bootstrap design isn't writing a lot of custom CSS, but rather combining classes like d-flex, p-5, and shadow-lg effectively. I finished the project feeling confident that I can now brand and build any kind of site using just the Bootstrap components.
